          <h2>Opera by George Frideric Handel</h2>
          <h3>Produced by Chase Henry Hopkins</h3>
          <div class="row center">

          </div>
          <br>
          <p class="left-align light">The adaptation of this opera is intended as a semi-staged collage of materials from George Frideric Handel’s great opera, ‘Alcina.’ It is a chance to enjoy the spectacular arias of this opera with theatrical staging to connect the characters, story, music and drama.</p>
          <p class="left-align light">Handel draws upon the colorful characters of Ariosto’s epic poem, ‘Orlando Furioso,’ in this drama of magical deception, disguised personalities, twisted love, and passionate lust. Drama and music are woven together to develop this opera seria steeped in mythological knights and sorceress queens, all of whom are vulnerable to their raw emotions and human faults. This concert adaptation invites the enchanting music and gripping drama to bring life to the tale of Handel’s ‘Alcina.’</p>

          <p class="left-align light">'Music at 22 Mansfield Street' London Concert Series</p>
          <p class="left-align light">Location: 22 Mansfield Street, Marylebone, London W1G 9NR, UK</p>
          <p class="left-align light">This performance took place as part of Bob and Elizabeth Boas' 'Music at 22 Mansfield Street' series. The concert was a fundraiser for the <a href="http://www.thetwomoorsfestival.co.uk/" target="_blank">Two Moors Festival</a>, in aid of the John Adie Memorial Trust.</p>
          <p class="left-align light whitespace">Concert Testimonials:</p>
          <p class="left-align light italic">"How did they do it? Six talented young singers and pianist Harvey Davies managed to pack a punch in the drawing room at 22 Mansfield Street, singing their guts out and showing off their acting skills to bring us a condensed version of Handel’s Opera Alcina.  Never heard to it? Neither had I, but anything Bob and Elisabeth Boas put on at their wonderful Mayfair home is of such a high standard that I rarely read the label and just turn up. I may not always care for the composer’s work, but that’s the risk I take.</p>
          <p class="left-align light italic">I was not disappointed by Alcina. It simply zinged along: I loved the music - easy on the ear - and the whole experience: singers easy on the eye, with women dressed as men giving an added piquancy. With six characters, it was way more complicated than the standard love triangle. Programme notes would have helped with this. Though we we were given a summary of the scene to come by Harvey Davies it would have been useful to check who was in love with whom with a quick glance at something written.</p>
          <p class="left-align light italic">They used the space so well, and provided such an intimate performance, that I could almost see this ‘Opera’ performed in my own home! The thought would never have crossed my mind before. In any case I’m sure many of the smaller music festivals would have a hit with this one. Ultimately it left me feeling glad to be alive, which is the highest praise I can give."</p>

          <h2>Synopsis</h2>
          <p class="center-align light"></p>
          <h3>Scene I</h3>
          <p class="left-align light">In the opening Recitativo, Bradamante and Melisso have arrived on Alcina's magical island disguised and in search of Bradamante's betrothed, Ruggiero. Alcina welcomes the visitors to her island (Recit: Alcina, Bradamante, Melisso). Alcina then sings of her adoration for Ruggiero, whom she has taken as lover, (Alcina: Di' cor mio). After Alcina's exit, Ruggiero confirms his love for Alcina (unaware it is a spell), and casts off the visitors for challenging his affections (Ruggiero: Di te mi rido). Ruggiero exits in search of Alcina, leaving Bradamante cruelly spurned and confused.</p>

          <h3>Scene II</h3>
          <p class="left-align light">Alcina's capricious sister, Morgana approaches Bradamante and sings of her new feelings in her flirtatious aria, (Morgana: O sapre al riso). Following her display of affection for Bradamante, Morgana's lover Oronte becomes angry and confronts Bradamante (Recit: Oronte). Caught between lovers, Bradamante tells Morgana that her feelings are the cause of problems for both of them, and Oronte to calm his jealousy (Bradamante: E gelosia). As a response to Bradamante, Oronte offers some advice that men should never trust women, as inspired by his own lover, Morgana (Oronte: Semplicetto!). Further angering Oronte, Morgana calls after Bradamante to return, and reiterates her new-found love (Morgana: Tornami).</p>

          <h3>Scene III</h3>
          <p class="left-align light">As the spell has been lifted thanks to Melisso’s magical ring, Ruggiero sings oh how he can now see Alcina's sorcery (Ruggiero: Qual Portendo). Melisso reminds Ruggiero that in loving Alcina, he has cruelly hurt his true love, Bradamante (Melisso: Pensa a chi). Reality is still dazed, but Ruggiero sings that he feels awful if what Melisso says is true (Ruggiero: Mi lusinga).  Alcina hears of Ruggiero's realization, and sings of both her broken heart and feelings of vengeance (Alcina: Ah! Mio cor).</p>

          <h3>Intermission</h3>

          <h3>Scene IV</h3>
          <p class="left-align light">Act two will open to find Oronte singing of women's trickery, (Oronte: E un folle). Morgana enters pleading for Oronte to take her back now that Bradamante has been reunited with Ruggiero (Recit: Oronte+Morgana, Aria Morgana: Credete al mio). Oronte then sings that a moment of love is worth more than the pain (Oronte: Un momento di). Despite Morgana’s wandering fidelity, the lovers are reunited.</p>

          <h3>Scene V</h3>
          <p class="left-align light">Alcina is furious with Ruggiero and calls him a traitor for abandoning her (Recit: Ruggiero+Alcina, Aria Alcina: Ma quando). Preparing to battle the monsters and sea storms of Alcina’s sorcery, Ruggiero sings (Ruggiero: Sta nell'Ircana). Melisso urges Bradamante to find safety (Recit: Bradamante+Melisso), but Bradamante is unafraid, as true and faithful love will prevail despite Alcina's sorcery (Bradamante: Alma fedel). Alcina, defeated and scorned, sings of cruel Ruggiero and Bradamante, while Bradamante and Ruggiero are reunited and sing of love conquering evil (Trio: Alcina, Ruggiero, Bradamante: Non e amor).</p>

In 1990 Harvey gave his South Bank debut during the Park Lane Group’s prestigious contemporary music series and has performed at most of the UK’s significant venues. Harvey is established as a fine chamber musician and accompanist. He has worked with many eminent musicians including Atar Arad, Alison Balsom, Alfie Boe, Rebecca Evans, Catrin Finch, Evelyn Glennie, Emma Johnson, Guy Johnston, and Jennifer Pike. Harvey runs a chamber music series in Manchester and Wilmslow with his exciting new group ‘The Pleyel Ensemble.’ Comprising some of the UK’s leading instrumentalists the Pleyels are indulging their interests in performing lesser-known 18th century as well as British chamber music and are actively commissioning new music. Harvey is the pianist in Ensemble Cymru. They were nominated for a Royal Philharmonic Society Award in 2006 and continue to receive acclaim for their innovative work in education as well as their performances.</p>
          <p class="left-align light">Harvey has recently been appointed as Teaching Fellow in Historical Performance at the Royal Northern College of Music where he is also a staff pianist. He is regularly an artist at the Two Moors Festival, and was for ten years official pianist at the National Eisteddfod of Wales and an ABRSM examiner. He lives in Manchester with his wife, the cellist Heather Bills.</p>
